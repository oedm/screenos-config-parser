# ScreenOS Configuration Parser
This repository provides a script for extracting filter and NAT rules from a ScreenOS configuration and subsequently converting them to JSON. Additionally, address objects, address groups, service objects and service groups are extracted. 

The parser is a work in progress and does not provide a full ScreenOS syntax. Obscure configurations may fail to be represented correctly.
